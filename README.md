🚀 FACE_ATM – Face Recognition-Based ATM Authentication System
FACE_ATM is a secure, user-friendly ATM authentication system that leverages facial recognition technology to verify users instead of traditional PIN-based access. Designed to enhance security and reduce the risk of fraud, this project integrates computer vision with banking operations to provide a seamless and contactless ATM experience.

🔐 Key Features
Facial Recognition Login: Users authenticate their identity through face detection and recognition, replacing the need for ATM cards or PINs.

User Registration: New users can securely register by capturing facial data and linking it to their account.

Account Operations: Supports basic ATM functionalities like balance inquiry, withdrawal, and deposit after successful authentication.

Secure Data Handling: Facial data and account details are securely stored and processed to ensure user privacy and integrity.

User-Friendly Interface: Clean and intuitive UI for both registration and transaction processes.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

OpenCV (for face detection and recognition)

SQLite / MySQL (for user and transaction data)

Tkinter / PyQt (for GUI interface)

📌 Project Goals
Replace conventional ATM login systems with biometric-based security.

Enhance banking security and convenience using face authentication.

Reduce ATM fraud due to stolen cards or guessed PINs.
